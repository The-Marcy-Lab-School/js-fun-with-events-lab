# JS Events Lab

## Objective

For this lab, you'll be recreating [this webpage](https://thuyanduong.github.io/js-events-example/). Experiment and interact with the demo webpage to discover all of its features. You can create and edit any files in this repo in order to implement the same functionality as seen in the demo webpage. 

## User stories
1. There is a counter that starts at `0` every time the page is loaded or refreshed. Every second, the number in the counter increases by 1.
2. As a user, I can click the `-` button in order to subtract 1 from the counter.
3. As a user, I can click the `+` button in order to add 1 to the counter. 
4. As a user, I can type something in the comment input, and when I submit the form, a new `<p>` tag will be added inside the `#list.comments` div without the page refreshing.
5. As a user, I can click on the Like button in order to "like" the number currently displayed in the counter. The liked numbers appears as an `<li>` in an unordered list along side how many times that number was liked. **Hint:** For this feature, it might helpful to create an object in your JavaScript file to keep track of how many times a number was liked

## Bonus Challenge (Pause Feature)
6. As a user, I can click on the `pause` button, which will accomplish the following: 
  - The counter on the page will no longer increment every second.
  - All other buttons on the page should be disabled.
  - The text in the `pause` button changes to `resume`.
7. As a user, while the counter is paused, I can click on the `resume` button, which will accomplish the following: 
  - The counter on the page will increment by 1 every second.
  - All other buttons on the page are no longer disabled.
  - The text in the `resume` button changes back to `pause`.
